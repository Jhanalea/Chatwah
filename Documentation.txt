Project Description
Chatwah is a command-line game application. The primary purpose of the app is to entertain users by presenting them with a series of hints in standard English that the user will have to translate to the Jamaican Patois dialect.

Game Logic

	•The hint class constructs the hint which contains a question and answer each. 
	•The hints are loaded into an arraylist which is then randomized prior to gameplay. 
	•The user is welcomed to the game and then prompted to answer the first question. 
	•The user input is then compared to the answer in the question bank. 
	•If the user’s answer is correct their score is incremented by 1. 
	•If not, they get 0 points. 
	•The game will continue until the final question in the bank. 

Potential Refinement
	•Implement a way for the user to restart the game without re-running the program. 
	•Limit the number of questions for each iteration of the game. 
	•Create the arrayList prior to starting the game and then remove already “used” questions, so that if the game is restarted there would only be fresh questions remaining. 
	•Identify some way to accept variations of answers. 

Future Features

	•Implement levels so that users face increasing difficulty as they progress through the game. 
	•Implement a timer, so instead of a predetermined number of questions the user can answer as many as possible within a predetermined time. 
	•Implement a streak feature, so if a user gets a string of questions in a row, they receive a point bonus. 
	•Implement a hint feature so if a user is stuck they can get further hint. 
	•Implement a try again feature so the user can re-do a question for half the points.
